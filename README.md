# Car and Non-Car Image Classifier

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either cars or non-cars.

## Overview
This repository contains the code and trained model for a car and non-car image classifier. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a dataset of car and non-car images.

## Files
- `car_classifier_model.h5`: The trained model file.
- `Car_and_NonCar_Classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the training and prediction code.
- `train_model.py`: Python script for training the model.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gogusaivarshith/ComputerVision.git
   cd ComputerVision/CarClassify
